# SpringQL-Based Data Stream Processing Service

This is a data stream processing service built upon the [SpringQL](https://github.com/SpringQL/SpringQL) data processing
library offering SQL-like statements for querying streamed data.  
As it has not been kept up-to-date until the end of the project, no guarantees
are made about it working or working correctly.
