# Pico Sensor

The pico sensor is a prototype for a sensor simulator (analogous to the one in [../sensor](../sensor))
which was intended to be run on a Raspberry Pi Pico.
As it was later on decided to drop this aspect of this thesis, the prototype
has never been fully tested, and thus no guarantees can be made about it working
or working correctly.
